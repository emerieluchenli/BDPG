Bayesian Distributional Policy Gradients AAAI-21 https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/17024

A distributional reinforcement learning method that minimizes the Wasserstein distance between the distribution of value function and that of the Bellman target using amortized variational Bayes. An information gain estimate is also derived as a curiosity-driven exploration incentive.

Base RL implementations were adapted from OpenAI Baselines.
